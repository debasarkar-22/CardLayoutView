# CardLayoutView

This is a framework to create a stacked cards like layout structure similar to the wallet or reminders app on our iphones.

In the App, you just have to initialize an instance of CardLayoutManager with the frame and the set of UIViewControllers to populate the content of the cards, and the rest will be taken care. 

The height of the open and closed cards, and top and bottom spaces are configurable via properties of the CardLayoutManager class.
